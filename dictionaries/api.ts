  {
    value: "16:9",
    desc: "Widescreen (video-first). Great for environmental portraits and story-driven scenes with plenty of horizontal breathing room. Feels modern and cinematic without being overly extreme."
  },
  {
    value: "9:16",
    desc: "Vertical full-screen (mobile-first). Perfect for full-body fashion, movement, and subject-forward framing. Demands clean backgrounds because clutter becomes very obvious in tall frames."
  },
  {
    value: "1:1",
    desc: "Square. Graphic, balanced, and calm—excellent for portraits, details, and still life. Strong medium-format vibe (6x6 Hasselblad/Rolleiflex) and classic social feed framing."
  },
  {
    value: "4:5",
    desc: "Vertical portrait (feed-optimized). Maximizes on-screen real estate without going full 9:16. Great for portraits with a little context—face, hands, and gesture read beautifully."
  },
  {
    value: "4:3",
    desc: "Classic camera feel (less panoramic than 16:9). A natural choice for documentary/lifestyle and scenes that need context. Echoes Micro Four Thirds and the ‘645’ medium-format character."
  },
  {
    value: "3:4",
    desc: "Vertical 4:3. Strong editorial/lifestyle portrait framing when you want subject + environment, but not the exaggerated height of 9:16."
  },
  {
    value: "3:2",
    desc: "35mm classic. Native to most full-frame and APS-C cameras—often the most ‘photographic’ and natural-looking ratio. Flexible for portraits, reportage, and landscapes."
  },
  {
    value: "2:3",
    desc: "Vertical 35mm. The standard portrait print ratio—elegant for full/half-body portraits with clean hierarchy (eyes → face → hands/gesture)."
  },
  {
    value: "21:9",
    desc: "Ultrawide cinematic. Strong sense of place and horizontal motion—excellent for establishing shots, travel, architecture, and narrative compositions. More practical on modern ultrawide displays than scope."
  },
  {
    value: "2.39:1",
    desc: "Anamorphic CinemaScope. Modern ‘Hollywood’ widescreen—very cinematic separation and negative space. Best for scenes, couples, and compositions that lean on environment and geometry."
  },
  {
    value: "2.35:1",
    desc: "Vintage CinemaScope. Slightly taller than 2.39:1 in feel—often associated with classic widescreen cinema. Great when you want scope without pushing the frame too thin."
  },
  {
    value: "5:4",
    desc: "Large format / fine art print. The 4x5 and 8x10 heritage ratio—calm, stately, gallery-friendly. Fantastic for fine-art portraits and architecture."
  },
  {
    value: "2:1",
    desc: "Univisium (the great compromise). Sits between 16:9 and scope—cinematic but still flexible. Excellent for editorial ‘hero’ images and streaming-style framing."
  },
  {
    value: "1.91:1",
    desc: "Wide social/preview. Practical for thumbnails, headers, and link previews. Photographically: a clean ‘hero image’ ratio with room for headline space if you ever add typography."
  },
  {
    value: "6:7",
    desc: "Medium format 6x7. The ‘ideal format’—premium, editorial, and flattering for portraits. Strong print-magazine vibe (Mamiya RB67 / Pentax 67)."
  },
  {
    value: "7:6",
    desc: "Horizontal 6x7 feel. Same premium medium-format character, but better for scenes, pairs, or subject-in-environment compositions."
  },
  {
    value: "6:6",
    desc: "True 6x6 square. Strict, iconic medium-format discipline—symmetry, minimalism, and graphic composition (Hasselblad/Rolleiflex energy)."
  },
  {
    value: "4:1",
    desc: "Extreme panorama (banner/header). Best for landscapes, architecture, and wide establishing shots. In portrait work it becomes conceptual—subject as a small accent in vast space."
  },
  {
    value: "8.5:11",
    desc: "US Letter (portrait). Useful for portfolio PDFs, one-pagers, and print layouts in North America. More ‘layout-driven’ than ‘camera-native’ framing."
  },
  {
    value: "11:8.5",
    desc: "US Letter (landscape). Great for presentations, contact-sheet style layouts, and landscape portfolio pages."
  },
  {
    value: "1:1.414",
    desc: "ISO A-series paper ratio (√2:1, e.g., A4/A3). The print king: scaling preserves proportions perfectly. Ideal for posters, covers, and print-ready editorial layouts."
